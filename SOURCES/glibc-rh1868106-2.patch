    resolv: Implement trust-ad option for /etc/resolv.conf [BZ #20358]
    
    This introduces a concept of trusted name servers, for which the
    AD bit is passed through to applications.  For untrusted name
    servers (the default), the AD bit in responses are cleared, to
    provide a safe default.
    
    This approach is very similar to the one suggested by Pavel Å imerda
    in <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1164339#c15>.
    
    The DNS test framework in support/ is enhanced with support for
    setting the AD bit in responses.
    
    Tested on x86_64-linux-gnu.
